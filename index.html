        <h2>Supporting girl child education</h2>
        <p>It is a brave decision to support a girl child education expenses.
            Each and every girl in a community needs to study so as to make an
            amazing impact on her peers and also her life.
            <p>Why is it important to educate a girl.</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Education will make a girl to be independent because she will
                be able to get a job to sustain herself.</li>
            <li>By educating a girl child this will enable her to avoid early
                marriages.</li>
            <li>Education makes a woman to make her own decisions without anyone
                opposing to them in a bad way.</li>
            <li>Through education, a girl/woman is able to build self confidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supplying sanitary towels.</h2>
        <p>Every girl at an adolescent stage passes through menstruation once a month
           This can make a girl loose concentration in whatever she is doing especially
           when she has nothing to cover herself with,that is the sanitary towel.
           Our foundation bases majorly on distributing sanitary towels to girls every month to 
           avoid period shaming from others.This makes the situation during the period time more
           relaxing and secretive because no one can notivce if a girl is on her periods.
