<p>It is a brave decision to support a girl child education expenses.
Each and every girl in a community needs https://bit.ly/33cuKo2to study so as to make an
amazing impact on her peers and also her life.
            <h4>Why is it important to educate a girl.</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>Education will make a girl to be independent because she will
                be able to get a job to sustain herself.</li>
            <li>By educating a girl child this will enable her to avoid early
                marriages.</li>
            <li>Education makes a woman to make her own decisions without anyone
                opposing to them in a bad way.</li>
            <li>Through education, a girl/woman is able to build self confidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supplying sanitary towels.</h2>
        <img src="images/download (1).jpeg" alt="">
<p>Every girl at an adolescent stage passes through menstruation once a month
This can make a girl loose concentration in whatever she is doing especially
when she has nothing to cover herself with,that is the sanitary towel.
Our foundation bases majorly on distributing sanitary towels to girls every month to 
avoid period shaming from others.This makes the situation during the period time more
relaxing and secretive because no one can notice if a girl is on her periods.</p>
        <h2>Gender awareness.</h2>
        <img src="images/raise-bullying-awareness_gender.jpg" alt="">
<p>In every society is better to practice gender equality.We should always practice to
be sensitive in whatever we do or say.Every gender matters,be it a girl or a boy. 
Girls are being undermined in the society and that is a vice we should all condemn.By 
doing this we make everyone feel important and comfortable.</p>
        <h2>Inventing in a small business.</h2>
        <img src="images/small-business-financial-services.jpg" alt="">
<p>Usually some girls out here are hard working but the problem is having something to start 
from.Our foundations comes in handy in helping giving out serious individuals loans so 
as to invent a small scale business and later on to bring interest. By doing this it makes
their mind busy and make them grow in a more positive way rather than being idle and broke.</p>
       <h2>Coordinating with water companies to the community.</h2>
       <img src="images/images.jpeg" alt="">
       <p>As the saying goes,cleanliness is next to godliness.Our foundation makes an effort to make 
           sure the girls are able to have water in their areas.Water is life! This makes them clean 
           and they are able to do lots of things when they have this resource.
